# Coevolutionary Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (CMPSO) [1]

## Disclaimer:
This repository acts as an implementation of the authors' work in MATLAB.

## Introduction:

Inspired by Zhan et al., the CMPSO algorithm runs a regular particle swarm optimization scheme on multiple swarms (swarm size = number of objectives) and introduces an information sharing algorithm which places the non-dominated solutions in the ***Archive*** matrix in the code. 

Further information can be found in the reference paper.
